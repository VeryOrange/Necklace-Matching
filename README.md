# Necklace-Matching
Challenge #383

Generally, two strings describe the same necklace if you can remove some number of letters from the beginning of one, attach them to the end in their original ordering, and get the other string. Reordering the letters in some other way does not, in general, produce a string that describes the same necklace.

Write a function that returns whether two strings describe the same necklace.
